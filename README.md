## What is it?

This is the repository of the [website](https://chouffy.net/) that contains tips & tricks I've learned.

## How does it works?

- I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit notes
- The [Obsidian Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) sync that with this repository
- The website is generated with [Materials for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) on push
