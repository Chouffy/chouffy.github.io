# YAML

A human-friendly data serialization language.

## General

* Whitespace indentation is used to denote structure, but number of space is irrelevant
* Tabs are not indentation
* Lists members are denoted in `-`

```yaml
# This is a comment
```

## Lists

```yaml
men: [John Smith, Bill Jones]
women:
  - Mary Smith
    age: 28
    height: 180
  - Susan Williams
```
