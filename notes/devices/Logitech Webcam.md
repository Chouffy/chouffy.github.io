# Logitech Webcam C250

## Webcam control panel on Windows 10

Logitech Webcam control panel can be launched with `"C:\Windows\System32\LogiDPPApp.exe" vid=1133&pid=2052&rev=9&`.

It can be guessed that `VID` and `PID` need to be customized for each device. USB VID and PID are in decimal, not in hex like in the device property. [Converter is available here.](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter)
