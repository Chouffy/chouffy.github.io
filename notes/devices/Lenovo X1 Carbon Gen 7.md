# Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 7

## Middle mouse button for click and scroll

[TPMiddle](https://sdx1.net/tools/tpmiddle/) was great to do it, but is incompatible with the X1C7.

Good thing there's W10Wheel:

1. In the *ELAN TrackPoint for Thinkpad* application, choose "Middle Button Action": *Middle Click*
1. In the *Windows Settings* application, go to *Devices â†’ Mouse* and check "Scroll inactive windows [...]"
1. Download and launch [W10Wheel](https://github.com/ykon/w10wheel.net)
1. In the taskbar, right-click on the W10Wheels icons and set "Trigger" to "MiddleDrag"
