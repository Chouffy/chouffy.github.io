(This is based on the 2017 edition)

Framework for developing, delivering, sustaining complex products.
* Small team of peoples = essence of scrum
* Founded on empiricism: knowledge comes from experience & making decisions on what is known
* Iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk

Must be implemented wholly.

* [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/download.html)

## Pillars

* Transparency
    * Most of the process must be visible to responsible of the outcome
    * Require a common language

* Inspection
    * Frequent inspect Scrum artifacts + Progress toward Sprint Goal = Detect variances
    * Not so frequent so it's not counterproductive
    * Better if done by skilled inspectors

* Adaptation
    * If deviation > acceptable = adjustment necessary ASAP

## Values

* Commitment, to do achieve goals
* Courage, to do the right thing and solve problems
* Focus, on their work & team goal
* Openness, about work and challenges
* Respect, between peoples as capable, independents peoples

The 5 above & 3 pillars build trust.

## Context

* *Development* is about the complex work done

## Scrum Team

* Self-organized: the team choose how best to accomplish work, rather being directed by external
* Cross-functional: all competencies are inside

Goal - Optimize:
* Flexibility
* Creativity
* Productivity

### Product Owner

Responsible to manage the Product Backlog & maximize value of product and the work of the DevTeam:
* Manage Product Backlog clearly
    * Help development team to understand items
    * Order items with desired goals & missions
    * Optimize value of the DevTeam work
    * Make Backlog visible, transparent, clear = what to do next
* DevTeam can do above, but PO is responsible
* PO = 1 person, can represent a committee
    * Product Marketplace Export
    * Lead facilitator of key stakeholder involvement
    * Product value maximizer
* Organization must respect PO decision, and DevTeam work on requirement defined by it

### Development Team

Deliver a potential release increment of Done at the end of the Sprint.
Responsible to transform Product Backlog item into Done Increments.

* 5~7 peoples
    * PO and Scrum Master not included unless they execute items
* Self-organized
    * Manage their own work
    * Accountable as a whole
* Cross-functional, can work autonomously
* No titles
* No sub-teams

### Scrum Master

Promote & support Scrum, but not the team boss:
* Helps to understand Scrum, inside and outside
* Servant-leader for the Scrum
* Help those outside the Scrum Team, protect from outside interactions

### Facilitator role

#### Scrum Master helps *Product Owner*:
* Ensure goal, scope, product domain is understood
* Find techniques for effective Product Backlog management
    * Help Team to understand need of clear/concise Backlog items
* Understand product planning in an empirical environment
* Help PO for Backlog sorting
* Facilitate Scrum events

#### Scrum Master helps *Dev. Team*
* Coach the DevTeam to be self-organized and cross-functional; or help implementing
* Help DevTeam to create high-values products and remove roadblocks
* Facilitate Scrum events

#### Scrum Master helps *organization*:
* Leading, coach, plan Scrum adoption/implementations
* Help understanding Scrum
* Cause change to improve productivity
* Work with Scrum Masters to increase Scrum application effectiveness

## Events

* Goal: minimize needs for other meetings
* All events are time-boxed (max duration)
* Sprint is a container for all other events
    * Sprint size is fixed
    * Each events helps to Inspect & Adapt

### Sprint

Time box to create a useable, releasable "Done" of a Product Increment

* Restart immediately each <= 1 month, usually 2 weeks
* Has a goal of what is going to be built, the work to do and the resultant
* Contain the all Events below
* No changes can be made that could endanger the Sprint Goal
* Scope can be clarified & re-negociated with PO <> DevTeam

#### Sprint cancelling

* Sprint can be cancelled by PO if the Sprint Goal is obsolete
    * Due to company direction or market
* All "Done" items are reviewed
    * Complete items can be accepted by PO
    * Uncompleted are re-estimated and put on Backlog

### Sprint Planning

Planning of the work to be done during Sprint

* Maximum 8h for 1 month Sprint, with entire Scrum team
* Input:
    * Product Backlog
    * Projected capacity
    * Product Increment
    * Past Performance of the Dev Team

Following questions are answered:

#### What Increment can be delivered from upcoming Sprint?
* DevTeam forecast all work to develop functionality
* PO discuss Sprint objective and Backlog items that would achieve Sprint Goal
* /# items depends on the DevTeam
* Only the DevTeam can assess what it can do in a Sprint

#### How will the work is done?
* Discussion by DevTeam how a Backlog item will be Done
    1. Design the system
    1. Forecast work to convert Product Backlog into working Increment
    1. Decompose work in units <= 1 day
        * Only for the first days of the Sprint
    1. DevTeam can explain to PO and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a team to accomplish Sprint Goal and create Increment
* Enough work is planned to make the Sprint Goal possible
* DevTeam self-organize works in the Sprint Backlog, both in Planning and during Sprint

#### Define Sprint Goal

* Objective that will be met during Sprint through Backlog implementation
    * Set of coherent Backlog items
    * But can be other coherent to help DevTeam to work together
* Provide guidance to DevTeam on why
* Sprint Goal is satisfied by implementing functionality & technology
* If works is different than DevTeam expect, they collaborate with PO to negotiate scope
* Defined by the Scrum Team after the Dev Team forecast the product Backlog that will be delivered in the Sprint

### Daily Scrum

Plan the work for the next 24h

* =15 min with DevTeam only, same time & place to reduce complexity
    * Scrum Master ensure the meeting is done, and start it
    * DevTeam directs it and only they participate
* Helps team collaboration & performance
    * Inspect
        * Work since last Daily Scrum
        * Progress toward Sprint Goal
        * Progress to complete Sprint Backlog
    * Forecast Sprint work
* Format
    * Up to the team: question, discussion, ...
        * What did I do yesterday to help DevTeam meet Sprint Goal?
        * What will I do today to do the same?
        * Do I see issues preventing me/DevTeam to reach goal?
* DevTeam can convene just after for detailed discussion

### Sprint Review

Inspect the increment, adapt Product Backlog

* Max 4h
    * Team and key stakeholder
* What has been done
    * But it's not an approval of what has been done
    * Stakeholder can give feedback
* What are the faced problem
* Demo of the work
* Discussion, adaptation of the product backlog
* Planning of what's next = a revised Product Backlog
* Review of timeline

### Sprint Retrospective

Create a plan for improvement during next sprint
* Max 3h
* Dimension of inspection
    * People
    * Relationship
    * Process & Tools
* Improvement initiatives can be added to next sprint or implemented anytime

## Sprint Artifacts

### Increment

Sum of all Product Backlog completed during Sprint + Value of increments of all previous Sprint

### Product Backlog

Single source of requirements, even if multiple teams
* Ordered list of need that needs to be done, defined by Product Owner
* PO is responsible for the Backlog, but DevTeam can also change it
* Backlog refinement
    * Details can be added
    * Complexity of the task is assessed
    * Max 10% of the capacity of the DevTeam
* Dev. team is responsible for all estimates
* PO tracks total work remaining

### Sprint Backlog

Set of product backlog items selected for the Sprint = selected Product Backlog items + plan for deliver them

* Belongs solely / Owned by DevTeam
* Include at least one item from last Retrospective
* Fixed during Sprint Planning. Only Dev. Team can change during Sprint and ASAP if necessary
* Visible picture to see what needs to be accomplish

### Definition of "Done"

Shared definition
* Increase transparency, defined by the development organization (or the Dev Team)
* Defined by the Development Team, for the Development Team
    * The minimum can also be defined by the organization
    * If multiple teams, all team must agree on the same definition of Done
    * As the team maturity increase, so the definition of Done criteria
    * Guide also the # of Product Backlog item the team can take during a Sprint
* Used to assess when work is complete on the increment
    * This increment is useable, so PO can immediately release it
    * Each increment is additive to all Increments and are tested
