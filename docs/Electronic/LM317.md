### Voltage adjustment
The on-board multi-turn potentiometer allows for adjustment of the output voltage.

Turning the pot CW decreases the output voltage while turning it  CCW increases it.

The available adjustment range will depend on the input voltage.  The LM317 has a voltage drop of approximately 1.25V, so the typical range is from a minimum of 1.25V up to the input voltage – 1.25V.  If powering the module with 12V for instance, the output range would be approximately 1.25V to 10.75V.
