Is a [[Zigbee]] compatible remote, great to control things in [[Home Assistant]].
## Notes
- For pairing, the remote needs to be *physically* extremely close to the Zigbee controller
- 4x Sync button to reset the remote & put in pair mode
- Remove the device from [[Home Assistant|HA]] if the reset fails
