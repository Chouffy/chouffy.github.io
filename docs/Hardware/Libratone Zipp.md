Is a home [[sound speaker]] used for [[Music]]
## Reverse engineering project
*Goal*: Send commands (voicing, volume, playback) to Libratone Zipp speaker from anything, not just the iOS/Android app. Request of documentation has been declined by Libratone.  
Except I missed it, there's no License document with used framework.

Thanks to some other people (see Acknowledgment), I was able to build:
* A Python class to handle communication with the Libratone Zipp: [python_libratone_zipp](https://github.com/Chouffy/python_libratone_zipp
* A Home Assistant module to provide a GUI for the module: [home_assistant_libratone_zipp](https://github.com/Chouffy/home_assistant_libratone_zipp)
