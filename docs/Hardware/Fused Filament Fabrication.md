Is a type of [[3D Print|3D Printing]] that uses melted thermoplastic disposed by a nozzle
## Filament
- Diameter
	- 1.75 mm (standard)
	- 2.85 mm (less common)
- Material (see also [Bambu Filament Guide](https://bambulab.com/en/filament-guide))
	- [[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymer|ABS]]
	- [[Polylactic Acid|PLA]]
	- [[Polyvinyl Alcohol|PVA]]
	- [[Polycarbonate|PC]]
	- [[Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol|PETG]]
	- [[High-Density Polyethylene|HDPE]]
	- [[High-Impact Polystyrene|HIPS]]
	- [[Polyamide Nylon|PA]]
	- [[Thermoplastic Polyurethane|TPU]]
	- Composite materials
		- [[Carbon Fiber|CF]]
		- [[Wood Fibers]]
- Quality is capital for successful printing 
	- Low quality filament can flatten into an oval
	- Varying thickness can distort the printed object
	- Dirty filament can clog nozzle
## Notes
- Build plate
	- Can require some heat or product so the 1st layer of filament can attach to it
		- Heated plate
		- Painter's tape
		- Kapton tape
		- [[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymer|ABS]] cement
