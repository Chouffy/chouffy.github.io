aliases:
  - ABS
  - ASA
  - Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate
---
Is a [[styrene]] material that can be used in [[Fused Filament Fabrication]]
## Notes
- Shrinks as it cools
	- Difficult to print >150 mm objects 
- Used in Lego bricks 
- [[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymer|ASA]] is slightly modified [[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymer|ABS]]
	- Easier to print
	- Improved mechanical resistance
	- Higher heat deflection 
- Color varieties: glow, color-diode
## Usage
- Temperature 
	- Melt at 150°C
		- Extrusion at 220-225°C
			- easier than [[Polylactic Acid|PLA]]
- Bed
	- Heated bed
	- Kapton tape
	- Thin layer [[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymer|ABS]] cement
	- Proprietary glue to reduce warping
- Environment 
	- Mild odor, affect chemically sensitive people / birds
	- Airbone microscopic particles than [[Polylactic Acid|PLA]]
