Is a [[polyester]] material that can be used in [[Fused Filament Fabrication]]
## Notes
- Strong alternative to [[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymer|ABS]]
- Higher impact resistance than [[Polylactic Acid|PLA]]
- Not as rigid as [[Polylactic Acid|PLA]], more rigid than most [[Polyamide Nylon]]
- Lower wrap than [[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymer|ABS]]
- Various colors and transparency
- Varieties
	- [[Carbon Fiber]] for rigidity
	- [[graphite]] for conduction
## Usage
- Temperature 
	- [[Glass Transition]]: 235°C
	- Compatible with printers that uses [[Polylactic Acid|PLA]]
- Bed
	- Heated at 85°C
