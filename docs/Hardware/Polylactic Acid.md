aliases:
  - PLA
  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate
  - PHA
---
Is a material that can be used in [[Fused Filament Fabrication]]
## Notes
- Biodegradable, derived from plant starch (corn, potato)
	- [[Polylactic Acid|PHA]] is made from fermented sugar
- Varieties with specific smell
- Colors possible 
	- Black colors have high level of carbon black filler, which can affect flow characteristics and change the melting point temperature 
## Usage
- Temperature 
	- [[Glass Transition]]: 60°C
	- Melting temperature: 160°C
		- Extrusion: 200°C
	- Small fan used to avoid remelting previous layers
- Bed
	- Covered with Painter's tape
- Strength 
	- More brittle than [[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymer|ABS]]
	- Less flexible than [[Polyamide Nylon]]
